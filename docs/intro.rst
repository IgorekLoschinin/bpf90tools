Introduction
============
**bpf90tools** is a tool that is a wrapper over the **BLUPF90** - https://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=start
family of programs written in python3.

The toolkit is designed for ease of use and automation of the design process
pipelines for assessing the breeding value of farm animals. The tools include the following capabilities:

- Interface to ``renumf90``, ``remlf90``, ``airemlf90``, ``blupf90`` and ``blupf90+(in development)`` - the main utilities for tribal value estimation calculations and other tasks.
- Interface for generating configuration files.
- Modules for processing of configuration files, for processing of output files and results, which are generated by f90 programs: ``solutions``, ``renaddxx.ped``, ``param``, ``(ai)remlf90.log``.
